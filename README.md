# Hybrid Movie Recommendation System

# Overview

This project implements a hybrid recommendation system that combines both collaborative filtering (using matrix factorization like SVD) and content-based filtering (using TF-IDF and cosine similarity). The system is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations by leveraging the strengths of both recommendation techniques.

# Features

- Collaborative Filtering: Uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to factorize a user-item interaction matrix and provide recommendations based on user preferences.
- Content-Based Filtering: Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend movies with similar content (e.g., genre, description).
- Hybrid Approach: Integrates the results from both collaborative and content-based filtering to generate a final set of recommendations.

Note: Ive only just made this and uploaded the task-3 content here because for task-4, I had edited the task-3 file itself and made it a repository. Basically I forgot to make separate repos for each of task 3 and 4.
